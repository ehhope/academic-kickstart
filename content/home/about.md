# About

Alex Hope received his B.A. in psychology & philosophy at the University of Alberta, Canada prior to pursuing a career in psychological research & teaching in New York. This work led to a deeper appreciation for statistics in understanding the efficacy of interventions and bodily (HRV) and brain dynamics (EEG,fMRI) underlie aspects of depression and anxiety. The utility of statistics and machine learning (ML) approaches helped motivate his decision to pursue a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of British Columbia where he currently resides. Alex's interests revolve around flexible pipeline development, complex statistical methods, ML implementations and how they can offer solutions in business and health.
