I was a teaching adjunct in the Department of Psychology at [City University of New York (CUNY)](https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/psychology). My efforts as a lecturer entailed:

  * Developing and delivering weekly lectures with an original curriculum, drawing content from historical and contemporary perspectives and research on human motivation, emotion, clinical disorders, neurobiology, and consciousness.
  * Designing quizzes, exams, term papers and presentations and evaluating student performance.
  * Mentoring and supervising students in both classroom and research settings

Here are the psychology courses I have taught within the department at CUNY:

  * PSYCH 32800: [States of Consciousness](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TdgU31Q9RIeJlQnHDeReq3k8kymo2nv2/view?usp=sharing)

  * PSYCH 32700: [Motivation and Emotion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NPzA4Mr1yJT8N4qN-bhv5gpMrR0BCBDA/view?usp=sharing)

  * PSYCH 25000: [Experimental Psychology (Methods in Research)](http://catalog.hunter.cuny.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=6&coid=15228)
